# LearningPyTorch

This repository is inspired by and loosely based on Karpathy's [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore). I use it to get a better understanding of PyTorch and grasp various concepts in NLP. The idea is to train language models of varying complexity using a text corpus of [Hacker News Comments](https://github.com/haukesteffen/HNPulse/blob/main/src/scrape.py).
